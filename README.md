# Cannon-ball Distance Calculator
## Overview
**This repository contains a physics-based program designed to calculate the distance traveled by a cannonball under three different scenarios. The program uses principles of projectile motion to determine the distance based on the initial speed of the cannonball, the angle of the cannon, and the height differences between the cannon and the target.**

## Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Horizontal Cannon
- Calculate the Time in the Air 
- Given the height of the cannon above the water line, compute the time the cannonball is in the air using the formula for free-fall motion.
- Calculate the Distance Traveled
- Use the speed of the cannonball and the time it is in the air to determine the horizontal distance traveled.
### Scenario 2: Angled Cannon at the Same Level
- Convert Speed into Vertical and Horizontal Components
- Decompose the speed of the cannonball into vertical and horizontal components using the angle of the cannon and basic trigonometry.
- Calculate Time in the Air
- Determine the total time the cannonball is in the air based on its vertical speed.
- Find Time to Reach Peak
- Compute the time it takes for the cannonball to reach its peak height (half of the total time in the air).
- Calculate Distance Traveled
- Use the horizontal speed of the cannonball and the total time in the air to find the distance traveled.
### Scenario 3: Angled Cannon at a Lower Level, Far Away
- Convert Speed into Vertical and Horizontal Components
- Decompose the speed of the cannonball into vertical and horizontal components using the cannon angle.
- Calculate Time in the Air
- Determine the total time the cannonball is in the air based on its vertical speed.
- Find Time to Reach Peak
- Calculate the time to reach the peak height of the cannonballâ€™s trajectory.
- Calculate Maximum Height
- Compute the maximum height reached by the cannonball using vertical speed and gravity.
- Determine Total Height
- Calculate the total height from the peak to the height of the cannon above the enemy ship.
- Calculate Time to Fall to the Enemy Ship
- Compute the time required for the cannonball to fall from its peak to the enemy ship.
- Calculate Distance Traveled
- Determine the distance traveled by using the horizontal speed and the total time in the air.
